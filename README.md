What is RNA-seq? To answer that lets give a brief introduction to RNA, and the motivations as to why we use RNA-seq analysis.  
Everyone knows that an organism reproduces. In doing so, it makes a rough , not exact, "copy" . In order to do this, it needs information, hereditary information, on how to make this inexact copy.  The information is stored in DNA. But another part of this reproduction is Ribonucleic acid, RNA, a nucleic acid present in all living cells. Its principal role is to act as a messenger carrying instructions from DNA for controlling the synthesis of proteins. However, in some cases, like with certain viruses, RNA rather than DNA carries the genetic information.
So then why do we use RNA-seq analysis? Why not go straight for that DNA? 
Let's say we have two sets of cell.  Let's say we know that the later are mutants . Let us further assume that. They have genes. Some are active. Some are not. If they are active, there is mRNA. RNA-sequencing analyzes which genes are active and how much they are transcribed. Now lets us say for set 1 of cells it exhibits A,B,C ,D and A,B,C are active , A is highly transcribed , B,C not. Set 2 exhibits A,B,C,D but D is also active. On top of that A,B,C all show different transcription levels. We can measure differential gene expression between the two set. We can now ask with some meaning: is the difference in gene expression the explanation- or linked to the reason- for the aberrant behavior of the second set.
